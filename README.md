# chat-with-me

Chat with me about any topic without using another platform than GitHub.
Let it be about [one of my blogs](https://ysfaran.github.io/blog/), general coding or new opportunities.

To do so just open a [new discussion](https://github.com/ysfaran/chat-with-me/discussions/new).
This repo has no other use case.

If you want to keep it more private feel free to <a href="mailto:yusuf.aran@outlook.de">send me an email</a>.
